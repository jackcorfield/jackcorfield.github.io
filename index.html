										<h2 class="major">Personal Profile</h2>
										<p>
									I am currently in my final year of study having spent the last 12 months living in Germany and working for Airbus Helicopters as a Software Engineer.
									<br>
									<br>
									My love for computer games began at a young age, playing on a Gameboy Advanced, I sank hours into games like ‘Pokémon Ruby’ and ‘Sonic Advanced’. Over the years I have owned many consoles and played many more games with some of my favourites being ‘Age of Empires’ and ‘Witcher 3 the Wild Hunt’. With the skills I picked up from Computer Science and my love of games I decide to undertake my current course with the aim of forging a career in the computer games industry.
									<br>
									<br>
									Since beginning at university I have had the amazing opportunity to take part in the Ukie Green Jam 2019, which was a challenge to say the least, but nonetheless was an invaluable experience that I am eager to follow up with another in the future.

										<h2 class="major">Stronghold (C#/ Unity)</h2>
										<p>
										This project was completed as part of my Technical Games Production module at the end of my second year at University. In this project I worked with a team of 5 other programmers to produce a game in Unity in 8 weeks. We decided as a group that we wanted to take the rule set of Dungeons and Dragons and apply that to a game with the play style of something like Xcom. As this was the first project at University that any of us had worked on as team and was completed remotely during the first lockdown we wanted to make use of Scrum and Kanban to try and give some structure to our teamwork. During this I acted as the Scrum master for our team and organised the daily standups that we ran for the length of the project.
										<br>
										<br>
										My responsibility in terms of programming was to build the level editior that out game made use of. The idea behind this was the it make it easier for our own programmers to make the levels we used for our demonstration, but also that if this were being released as a real game it would be good if the community who played the game would be able to make their own levels too. The editor allowed the user to click an existing tile which would become highlighted and then could spawn one of twp tile tile types in any of the cardinal directions. I also wanted to be able to allow for a degree of verticality in the levels, so I added a ladder tile that could have tile either placed at the top or the bottom of it but could not have environment decorations.
										<br>
										<br>
										Given that I had the most in depth knowledge of the map system I was also given the job of making the path finding system that allowed for the chacter to move around the level. For this I decided to write my own A* Algorithm instead of using the built in one to Unity as it gave me a greater degree of control over how it worked. The main thing I needed extra control over was the movement costs of different tiles. We wanted the ability to have "difficult" terrain which meant that the movement cost across it was doubled. I also wanted the grid used by the pathfinding algorithm to be created dynamically created for each level as this not only made it easier for the level creator but also meant that certain tiles could have been added or removed during gameplay and the grid would dynamically adapt to this at runtime.

										<h2 class="major">Pacman (C++/ S2D)</h2>
										<p>
										This project was undertaken during my first semester at university; The task was to try to recreate Pacman while also further expanding upon the gameplay. The version I created stays reasonably faithful to the original but has a few differences to spice up the gameplay.
										<br>
										<br>
										Overall I think had a good attempt at this task with extra features such as extra levels when the player scrolls instead of looping back around, a stamina bar that allows the player to sprint and power ups that add extra options to escape the ghosts. There are however some issues with the way that the game was constructed, the main one being that although an object orientated approach was attempted it was not done to a level that I am happy with. If I were to go back to it this is certainly something I would want to address.

										<h2 class="major">Super Mario World (C++/ SDL)</h2>
										<p>
										This project was my first attempt at creating a 2D game engine. The task was to use SDL in order to create an engine that it would be possible to build a Super Mario Bros game in. This meant having a level manager, the ability to load and display textures and to load and manage music. One significant element was the creation of a text manager as the version of SDL we were using didn’t have a compatible library.
										<br>
										<br>
										During this project the creation of the engine went very well with a solid OO methodology being followed. The part of this project where I let myself down was not focusing enough on the game that was meant to be made with the engine. As a result the game is lacking in certain areas but I am pleased the engine itself ended up working very well.

										<h2 class="major">Game Jam 2019 (C#/ Unity)</h2>
										<p>
										This was the first Game Jam that I have taken part in and the first time that I had used Unity. The initial plan had been to try and make a resource management game where the world has been reset by over abundance of pollution. The player would act as mother nature and have to try and support a simple AI, that was meant to be acting a human civilisation, and try and get them back to modern day without them repeating the mistakes that reset the world in the first place. 
										<br>
										<br>
										As it was one of the first times that many of our group had used Unity we ended up getting stuck while creating the tile map for the world in such a way that the AI would have been able to interact with it. Although in the end we didn’t really have what I would call a game we had a great time taking part and learnt a lot of valuable lessons about scope and time management.
