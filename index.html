										<h2 class="major">Personal Profile</h2>
										<p>
									I am currently in my second year of study at Staffordshire University on Computer Games Programming BSc (Hons). I have been interested in studying computing ever since secondary school scoring A’s in both Maths and Computer Science. At A Level I obtained B’s in both subjects.
									<br>
									<br>
									My love for computer games began at a young age, playing on a Gameboy Advanced, I sank hours into games like ‘Pokémon Ruby’ and ‘Sonic Advanced’. Over the years I have owned many consoles and played many more games with some of my favourites being ‘Age of Empires’ and ‘Witcher 3 the Wild Hunt’. With the skills I picked up from Computer Science and my love of games I decide to undertake my current course with the aim of forging a career in the computer games industry.
									<br>
									<br>
									Since beginning at university I have had the amazing opportunity to take part in the Ukie Green Jam 2019, which was a challenge to say the least, but nonetheless was an invaluable experience that I am eager to follow up with another in the future.

										<h2 class="major">Pacman (C++/ S2D)</h2>
										<p>
										This project was undertaken during my first semester at university; The task was to try to recreate Pacman while also further expanding upon the gameplay. The version I created stays reasonably faithful to the original but has a few differences to spice up the gameplay.
										<br>
										<br>
										Overall I think had a good attempt at this task with extra features such as extra levels when the player scrolls instead of looping back around, a stamina bar that allows the player to sprint and power ups that add extra options to escape the ghosts. There are however some issues with the way that the game was constructed, the main one being that although an object orientated approach was attempted it was not done to a level that I am happy with. If I were to go back to it this is certainly something I would want to address.

										<h2 class="major">Simple 3D Scene (C++/ OpenGL)</h2>
										<p>
										This assignment was to use OpenGL in order to render a simple scene. The main components of this were to set up correct material and lighting and create a function capable of loading OBJ files into the scene.  
										<br>
										<br>
										Completing this project was a valuable first dive into programming graphics in 3D space. It was also an interesting experience creating the OBJ loader as it was something that was quite a struggle to construct, but a huge sense of achievement once successfully completed. This project demonstrates a better approach to object oriented design than the PACMAN project above but I recognise that there are areas for further code optimisation.

										<h2 class="major">Super Mario World (C++/ SDL)</h2>
										<p>
										This project was my first attempt at creating a 2D game engine. The task was to use SDL in order to create an engine that it would be possible to build a Super Mario Bros game in. This meant having a level manager, the ability to load and display textures and to load and manage music. One significant element was the creation of a text manager as the version of SDL we were using didn’t have a compatible library.
										<br>
										<br>
										During this project the creation of the engine went very well with a solid OO methodology being followed. The part of this project where I let myself down was not focusing enough on the game that was meant to be made with the engine. As a result the game is lacking in certain areas but I am pleased the engine itself ended up working very well.

										<h2 class="major">Game Jam 2019 (C#/ Unity)</h2>
										<p>
										This was the first Game Jam that I have taken part in and the first time that I had used Unity. The initial plan had been to try and make a resource management game where the world has been reset by over abundance of pollution. The player would act as mother nature and have to try and support a simple AI, that was meant to be acting a human civilisation, and try and get them back to modern day without them repeating the mistakes that reset the world in the first place. 
										<br>
										<br>
										As it was one of the first times that many of our group had used Unity we ended up getting stuck while creating the tile map for the world in such a way that the AI would have been able to interact with it. Although in the end we didn’t really have what I would call a game we had a great time taking part and learnt a lot of valuable lessons about scope and time management.
